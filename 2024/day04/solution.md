# Day 4 Answers: Basic Linux Shell Scripting for DevOps Engineers

Task 1: Explain in your own words and with examples what Shell Scripting means for DevOps.
- 'Shell scripting is writing a file that contains a series of commands you would normally type in the terminal â€” so they can run automatically.'
--> Great for automating tasks.
--> Saves time and reduces manual errors.

Task 2: What is `#!/bin/bash`? Can we write `#!/bin/sh` as well?
- #!/bin/bash is called a shebang (or hashbang). It appears on the first line of a script and tells the operating system which interpreter to use to execute the script.
- #! is the sheband marker.
- /bin/bash is the path to the Bash shell, a common Linux shell.
- #!/bin/sh  --> Yes, we can write but  limited features.
- bash has extra features like arrays, [[ ]], and more advanced string operations.
- sh is usually more POSIX-compliant and may be linked to a smaller shell (like dash on Ubuntu).
